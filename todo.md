# TODO
- Script for converting TI2 levels
  - Load dynamic tiles
  - Fix bug where TE3 scrambles texture IDs after saving
- E1M2 grass arrows (make a floor decal shape instead)
- Make it so fire cannot be walked through, but projectiles can still go through
- Level intro
- Weapon wheel / menu
- Feedback when you try to select a weapon you don't have.
- Re-record enemy voices
- Loading screen?
- Armor

## Ideas

- Episode 4: Titan Loose Ends
  - Electric sand
  - Wraiths on motorcycles??
  - Armor that makes game run in slow motion when you are firing your weapon
